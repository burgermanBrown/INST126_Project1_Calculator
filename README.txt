This is version 1.0 of a rudimentary calculator python program.

The calculator features addition, subtraction, multiplication and 
division which can be chosen by the user by entering 1, 2, 3 or 4. 

This calculator also allows for the user to decide how many values
they want to evaluate for a given operation. Each of these values must be integers.

Due to the inaccuracy of floating point values, this calculator will display floating
point quotients as mixed numbers.

Once the user has completed entering their desired values, the program will evalute 
the chosen operation and print the result.
